# This Repository contains all the code for my personal portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages
## As of now, the site is built solely with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and some JQuery for animations)

## Welcome to my personal portfolio web application / project!

## For building this project, I used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons
